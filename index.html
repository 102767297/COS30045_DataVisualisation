                    Such use of renewable energy is of critical importance to ensure less global climate change and sustainable development.
                    Renewable energy can lower emissions by an order of magnitude, enhance energy security, and promote energy supply
                    diversification-all factors that essentially help the nations in the development and implementation of their Nationally
                    Determined Contributions under the Paris Agreement.

            <h2>Background and Motivation</h2>
            <p>
                The OECD provides indicators to track renewable energy adoption across member countries, including environmental
                policies, government spending, research and development activities, and broadband access. This project visualizes key
                renewable energy indicators in selected OECD countries from 2015 to 2024, helping stakeholders understand the current
                state of renewable energy initiatives and their impact on environmental sustainability.

				<h2>Renewable Energy Production vs Consumption Analysis in East Asia (2015-2021)</h2>
				
				<div class="key-findings">
					<h3 class="section-title">Key Findings</h3>
					<ul class="section-list">
						<li class="section-list-item"><strong>China's Dominance:</strong> China leads in both production and consumption, with nearly perfect alignment between the two. Its renewable energy market shows consistent growth, reaching up to ~2500 TWh by 2021.</li>
						<li class="section-list-item"><strong>Japan's Steady Progress:</strong> Japan maintains a production surplus, slightly exceeding consumption, indicating potential for export. Its market size ranges from 150-200 TWh, with steady growth and some acceleration post-2019.</li>
						<li class="section-list-item"><strong>Korea's Divergence:</strong> Korea shows increasing separation between production (growing rapidly from 30 TWh to 55 TWh) and consumption (moderate growth from 20 TWh to 45 TWh), suggesting potential for export.</li>
						<li class="section-list-item"><strong>Taiwan's Growth:</strong> Taiwan’s market has accelerated since 2018, with balanced growth in both consumption and production, staying in the 10-15 TWh range.</li>
						<li class="section-list-item"><strong>Mongolia's Emergence:</strong> Starting from near-zero levels, Mongolia demonstrates the most dramatic growth pattern, focusing primarily on production with limited consumption data available.</li>

					<h3 class="section-title">Regional Analysis</h3>
					<p>The analysis of the renewable energy landscape in East Asia reveals several distinct trends:</p>
					<ul class="section-list">
						<li class="section-list-item"><strong>Scale Disparity:</strong> China remains the dominant player, with a market scale approximately 10 times larger than Japan's. Korea, Taiwan, and Mongolia show progressively smaller scales.</li>
						<li class="section-list-item"><strong>Growth Trajectories:</strong> All countries exhibit positive growth but at different paces: China shows steady growth, Japan experiences consistent progress with acceleration after 2019, Korea has an increasing gap between production and consumption, Taiwan sees post-2018 acceleration, and Mongolia experiences exponential growth.</li>
						<li class="section-list-item"><strong>Market Maturity:</strong> More mature markets (China and Japan) show closer alignment between production and consumption, while emerging markets (Korea and Mongolia) have greater variability, indicating export potential. Taiwan's market is well-balanced between consumption and production.</li>
						<li class="section-list-item"><strong>Regional Integration:</strong> The gaps between production and consumption suggest potential for international trade, with Korea and Mongolia likely to engage in export activities, while China and Japan focus more on domestic utilization.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<div class="key-stat">
					<h3 class="section-title">Production-Consumption Patterns</h3>
					<ul class="section-list">
						<li class="section-list-item"><strong>China:</strong> Shows perfect alignment between production and consumption, suggesting efficient domestic utilization.</li>
						<li class="section-list-item"><strong>Japan:</strong> Has a slight production surplus, indicating export potential.</li>
						<li class="section-list-item"><strong>Korea:</strong> Displays a growing divergence between production and consumption, with production growing faster, indicating increasing export capacity.</li>
					</ul>

				<div class="key-stat">
					<h3 class="section-title">Volume Analysis</h3>
					<p>The scale and growth of renewable energy markets in East Asia vary significantly:</p>
					<ul class="section-list">
						<li class="section-list-item"><strong>Large-Scale Markets:</strong> China and Japan dominate the regional volume, with China’s production reaching 1500-2500 TWh and Japan's at 150-200 TWh.</li>
						<li class="section-list-item"><strong>Mid-Scale Markets:</strong> Korea shows moderate volumes, growing from 30 TWh to 55 TWh.</li>
						<li class="section-list-item"><strong>Emerging Markets:</strong> Taiwan grows steadily in the 10-15 TWh range, while Mongolia shows rapid production growth starting from near-zero levels in 2015-2017.</li>
